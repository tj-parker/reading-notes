## REST

Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers

The techniques used today are designed to talk to a small group of machines as opposed to talk to all of the machines

An HTTP GET is used to retrieve information from other systems

A POST is used to add something to another system

A PUT is used to replace something in another system

A PATCH is a partial update of a system
