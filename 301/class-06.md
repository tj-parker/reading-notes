## An Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a program used to execute JavaScript on our computers, or a JavaScript runtime

Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code that a ocmputer can execute, and it what Node is built on

npm is a package manager that comes bundled with Node

my computer is runnign node v18.9.0 and npm 8.19.1
