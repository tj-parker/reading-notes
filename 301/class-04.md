# Class 04 Reading Notes

## React Docs - Forms

A controlled component is an input form element whose value is controlled by React

Store the users responses from the form into state as soon as they are entered to control what happens in that form on subsequent user input

Target what the user is entering with `event.target.name`

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator

A ternary operator is used to shorten `if` statements into one line of code

```javascript
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
```

becomes

```javascript
x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
```
