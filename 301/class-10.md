# Class 10 Reading Notes

## Understand the JavaScript Call Stack

A call is a function invocation. In a call stack, the call is executed one at a time

LIFO means "last in, first out" meaning the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be popped out

A stack overflow occurs when therre is a recursive function without an exit point

## JavaScript error messages

A reference error occurs when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared

A syntax error occurs when something cannot be parse in terms of syntax

A range error occurs when you try to manipulate an object with an invalid length

A type error occurs when the types you are trying to use or access are incompatible

A breakpoint is a point in the code where if the line is run you will be able to see what has hapened before that point and can be used to try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting as expected

A debugger statement sets a breakpoint
