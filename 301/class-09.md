# Class 09 Reading Notes

## Functional Programming Concepts

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

A pure function returns the same result if given the same argument, while not causing any observable side effects

Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable, as well as easier to test

Immutability means unchanging over time or unable to be changed

Referential transparency is if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input

## Node JS Modules and require()

A module is a seperate file that has a certain functionality within the application, that's called upon whenever needed

The word require is used to import a module into another file

To make a module available, enter `module.exports` at the end of the file, and assign it whatever you want to be avaiable
