# Class 05 Reading Notes

## HTML Media

The `alt` attribute's value is supposed to be a textual description of an image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render

alt text is helpful for improving accessibility, as if the user is visually impaired and using a screen reader the alt text can describe the picture for them

The `<figure>` element provides a semantic container for figures, and clearly links the figure to a caption

GIFs are popular for simple animations, whereas SVG is great for elements that need to scale to different sizes accurately, like diagrams and icons

PNG is ideal for a screenshot because of its precise reproduction of source images

## CSS Color and Style

Foreground color is defined by the `color` property, and affects the elements that are "in the front" `background-color` defines the color of the elements components that are "behind" the foreground. These can be used on just about any element

A set of standard color names have been defined as keywords, but for more precise color options hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL are also available

Only a certain number of fonts are generally available accross all systems, which are referred to as web safe fonts.

`font-size` of an element controls how big or small the text is, `font-weight` sets how bold the text is, and `font-style` is used to turn italic text on or off

Some ways to add space around a text element are `line-height`, which sets the height of each line of text, and `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing` which set the spacing between the characters and text
