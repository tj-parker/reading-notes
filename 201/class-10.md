# Class 10 Reading Notes

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

**Syntax errors** are spelling erros in code that cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through

**Logic errors** are errors where the syntax is correct but the code doesn't work as intended

Common errors I have ran into in the past include, but are not limited to, forgetting commas and semicolons, and misspelling functions when calling or invoking them

## The JavaScript Debugger

The JavaScript dubugger allows you to watch the value of variables and "breakpoints", or places in the code that allow you to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

The Call stack shows you what code was executed to get to the current line
