The `transform` property offers alternative way to size, position, and change elements.

One example of a transform is `scale`, which can change the appeared size of an element. This can be used to emphasize or deemphasize content on a page.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

Transistions allow a developer the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such asa when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted
