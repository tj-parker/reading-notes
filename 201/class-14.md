## CSS Transforms

The `transform` property offers alternative way to size, position, and change elements.

One example of a transform is `scale`, which can change the appeared size of an element. This can be used to emphasize or deemphasize content on a page.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

Transistions allow a developer the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such asa when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted

Transitions are good for single state changes, however when more control is required animations can allow for multiple state changes

Well placed transitions can excite users, thus increasing engagement. Improving at this can help create content that stands out

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

Studies show that working in groups is more effiecient than working alone, as groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly, and find better solutions to problems. People working in teams also are shown to achieve better results and report higherr job satisfaction.

In 2012, Google started an initiative known as Project Aristotle to study hundreds of their teams and figure out why some succeeded and others failed.

There didn't appear to be any evidence that the composition of a team, be it different personality types, skills, or backgrounds, made any difference. Strangely, two teams with nearly identical makeups could have radically different results.

Group norms typically override individual preferences and behaviors, encouraging defernce to the team. Reserchers found that how well teammates treated one another tended to lead to consistent success for that team.

On good teams, researchers notice that members all spoke in roughly the same proportion. Even if the team members are speaking each over eachother so long as everyone feels they get their say in the dyanmic worked. Also, good teams were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone, expressions, and other nonverbal cues. More casual, conversational social dynamics tended to lead to a more successful team as those groups were more sensitive to each other's moods and emotions.

This leads to something known as "psychcological safety": where the team climate allowed for trust that memebers could say what they thought without fear of being embarrassed, rejected, or punished for doing so. Google's data indicated that more than anything else, psychological safety was the most critical element to making a team succeed.
