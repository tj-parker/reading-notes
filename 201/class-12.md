# Class 12 Reading Notes

## JavaScript Canvas

`<canvas>` allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript

`<canvas>` requires a closing `</canvas>` tag. Any content between the openign and closing tags is fallback content that will only display if the browser doesn't support the element

The `<canvas>` element features the `getContext()` method, which returns a render context object by taking one argument which is the type of context. For example, the `"2d"` argument is used to get a 2D rendering context object

## Chart.js

Chart.js can be installed after development dependencies are installed. First install node and npm, the clone the Chart.js repo to a local directory, and run `npm install` in the command line.

Available chart types include bar, line, and pie charts

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables as they are easier to look at and convey data quickly
